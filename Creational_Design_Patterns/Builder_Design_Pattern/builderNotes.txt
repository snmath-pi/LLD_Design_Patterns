- creational design pattern utilised for creation of complex objects
- solves the problem of complex & telescopic constructors
- helps with immutable classes
- less need for exposing the setters
-pros
    - good way to address complexity
    - can be refactored
-cons
    - uses inner static class
    - class returned is immutable
    - u have to take into account end to end chain in design
